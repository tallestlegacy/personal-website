	<h3>by Edgar Allen Poe</h3>
	<div class="verse"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary,
<br>Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
<br>While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
<br>As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
<br>'Tis some visitor,' I muttered, tapping at my chamber door -
<br>Only this, and nothing more.'<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div><div class="verse"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
<br>And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
<br>Eagerly I wished the morrow; - vainly I had sought to borrow
<br>From my books surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the lost Lenore -
<br>For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore -
<br>Nameless here for evermore.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div><div class="verse"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
<br>Thrilled me - filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
<br>So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
<br>'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door -
<br>Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door; -
<br>This it is, and nothing more,'<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div><div class="verse"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
<br>"Sir,"" said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
<br>But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
<br>And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
<br>That I scarce was sure I heard you' - here I opened wide the door; -
<br>Darkness there, and nothing more."<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div><div class="verse"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
<br>Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
<br>But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,
<br>And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore!'
<br>This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!'
<br>Merely this and nothing more.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div><div class="verse"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
<br>Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
<br>'Surely,' said I, 'surely that is something at my window lattice;
<br>Let me see then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore -
<br>Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore; -
<br>'Tis the wind and nothing more!'<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div><div class="verse"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
<br>In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore.
<br>Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
<br>But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door -
<br>Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door -
<br>Perched, and sat, and nothing more.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div><div class="verse"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
<br>By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
<br>'Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,' I said, 'art sure no craven.
<br>Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore -
<br>Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!'
<br>Quoth the raven, 'Nevermore.'<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div><div class="verse"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
<br>Though its answer little meaning - little relevancy bore;
<br>For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
<br>Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door -
<br>Bird or beast above the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
<br>With such name as 'Nevermore.'<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div><div class="verse"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only,
<br>That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
<br>Nothing further then he uttered - not a feather then he fluttered -
<br>Till I scarcely more than muttered 'Other friends have flown before -
<br>On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.'
<br>Then the bird said, 'Nevermore.'<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div><div class="verse"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
<br>'Doubtless,' said I, 'what it utters is its only stock and store,
<br>Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster
<br>Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore -
<br>Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore
<br>Of "Never-nevermore."'<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div><div class="verse"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,
<br>Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;
<br>Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
<br>Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore -
<br>What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
<br>Meant in croaking 'Nevermore.'<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div><div class="verse"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
<br>To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
<br>This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
<br>On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,
<br>But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,
<br>She shall press, ah, nevermore!<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div><div class="verse"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
<br>Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
<br>'Wretch,' I cried, 'thy God hath lent thee - by these angels he has sent thee
<br>Respite - respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!
<br>Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!'
<br>Quoth the raven, 'Nevermore.'<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div><div class="verse"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->'Prophet!' said I, 'thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil! -
<br>Whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
<br>Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted -
<br>On this home by horror haunted - tell me truly, I implore -
<br>Is there - is there balm in Gilead? - tell me - tell me, I implore!'
<br>Quoth the raven, 'Nevermore.'<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div><div class="verse"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->'Prophet!' said I, 'thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil!
<br>By that Heaven that bends above us - by that God we both adore -
<br>Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
<br>It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore -
<br>Clasp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels name Lenore?'
<br>Quoth the raven, 'Nevermore.'<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div><div class="verse"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->'Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!' I shrieked upstarting -
<br>'Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
<br>Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
<br>Leave my loneliness unbroken! - quit the bust above my door!
<br>Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!'
<br>Quoth the raven, 'Nevermore.'<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div><div class="verse"><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
<br>On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
<br>And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
<br>And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
<br>And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
<br>Shall be lifted - nevermore!<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div>
