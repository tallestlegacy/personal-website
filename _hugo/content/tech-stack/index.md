# Javascript & TypeScript

JavaScript is my strongest suite

```js
export const main = () => console.log("You can never escape JS");
```

I've built Backends in JS using `express` and `serverless`

# Dart ❤️ Flutter

I enjoy building cross platform apps with Flutter to the point that most of my
PlayStore apps are build in Flutter

```dart
import "package:flutter/material.dart";

void main () {
    runApp(
        MaterialApp(
            home : Scaffold (
                appBar : AppBar(
                    title : const Text ("I LOVE FLUTTER!!")
                ),
            ),
        )
    );
}

```

# Web

I love web development, I'm into :

- simplicity and minimal UI/UX
- quirky design trend
- expressionism

> I'm good with
>
> - Vanilla CSS
> - SASS/SCSS
> - Tailwind

I have enough experience building consumer software to create any design you throw at me.
